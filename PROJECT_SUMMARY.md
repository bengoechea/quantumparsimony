**Purpose:** Introduction and overview of the framework

**Key Sections:**
- Mission statement
- Core insights (Nature's DRY Principle)
- Quick navigation cards to all sections
- Why ontological clarity matters
- Ken Mendoza's contribution

### 2. Entropy vs Information
**Purpose:** Clarify the confusion between thermodynamic and information entropy

**Content:**
- Clausius' thermodynamic entropy (1850s)
- Von Neumann's quantum entropy and fateful advice (1940s)
- Shannon's information theory (1948)
- How confusion accumulated
- Three distinct concepts: thermodynamic, information, computational
- Practical implications across disciplines

**Key Insight:** Heat ≠ Information, despite 75 years of conflation

### 3. Danger Theory
**Purpose:** Demonstrate ontological clarity in immunology

**Content:**
- Self/Non-Self paradigm problems
- Polly Matzinger's Danger Theory (1994)
- Why danger detection unifies immunology
- Parallel to entropy confusion
- Computational modeling implications
- Why it remains underappreciated

**Key Insight:** Immune systems respond to danger signals, not identity classification

### 4. Computational Modeling
**Purpose:** Explain labyrinthine orthogonal computational modeling framework

**Content:**
- Ontology-driven modeling principles
- What "labyrinthine orthogonal" means
- Philosophical grounding (ontology + epistemology)
- Interdisciplinary knowledge integration
- Information-theoretic foundations
- Nature's DRY principle in action
- In silico experiments as discovery tools

**Key Insight:** Accurate models require correct ontology, not convenient assumptions

### 5. Quantum Parsimony
**Purpose:** Reframe quantum mechanics through computational lens

**Content:**
- Problems with "quantum mechanics" terminology
- What Quantum Parsimony means
- The math as grammar missing structure
- Structure = computational parsimony
- Reinterpreting quantum phenomena (superposition, entanglement, uncertainty, measurement, duality)
- Nature's prime directive: parsimony
- Implications for quantum computing
- Resolving interpretation debates

**Key Insight:** Quantum phenomena are computationally optimal solutions, not mechanical mysteries

### 6. Historical Timeline
**Purpose:** Trace accumulation and resolution of conceptual confusion

**Timeline:**
- 1850s: Clausius introduces thermodynamic entropy
- 1870s: Boltzmann's statistical mechanics
- 1920s-1930s: Von Neumann's quantum entropy
- 1940s: Von Neumann advises Shannon
- 1948: Shannon's information theory
- 1950s-1960s: Confusion spreads through education
- 1961: Landauer's principle
- 1994: Matzinger's Danger Theory
- 2000s: Quantum information theory matures
- 2010s: Recognition of problems
- 2020s: Mendoza's ontological clarification
- Present & Future: Path forward

**Key Insight:** Conceptual confusion accumulates but can be systematically resolved

### 7. Philosophy of Science
**Purpose:** Establish philosophical foundations for the framework

**Content:**
- Ontology informed by epistemology
- Ontological realism vs instrumentalism
- Epistemological humility
- Disciplines as convenient category names
- Discipline-boundless thinking
- Iterating consciously, rationally, aggressively
- In silico experiments as discovery tools
- Seeing nature's computational engine
- Practical impact of philosophical grounding

**Key Insight:** Philosophy isn't luxury—it's prerequisite for effective science

## 🧬 Core Concepts Documented

### 1. Nature's DRY Principle
Just as code follows "Don't Repeat Yourself," nature's computational substrate operates with:
- **Minimal** complexity
- **Directed** evolution
- **Parsimonious** optimization

### 2. Ontological Clarity
Understanding what actually exists vs convenient categories:
- Thermodynamic entropy ≠ Information entropy
- Danger detection ≠ Self/non-self classification
- Computational structure ≠ Mechanical causation

### 3. Discipline-Boundless Science
Recognizing that:
- Disciplines are human organizational categories
- Nature's computational substrate ignores boundaries
- Same principles operate across apparent domains
- True understanding requires interdisciplinary synthesis

### 4. Computational Naturalism
Nature IS computational (not metaphorically):
- Physical processes = Information processes
- Parsimony as fundamental constraint
- Quantum behavior = Computational optimization
- Living systems = Computational systems

### 5. Philosophy Matters
Ontological clarity informed by epistemology:
- Determines what questions to ask
- Shapes how models are built
- Reveals or obscures true structure
- Prerequisite for genuine progress
