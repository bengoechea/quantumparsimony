        <h2>The Foundation: Ontology-Driven Modeling</h2>
        
        <p>
          Ken Mendoza's approach to computational modeling begins with a fundamental insight: 
          <strong>you cannot build accurate models on flawed ontologies</strong>. Before writing 
          a single line of code, you must understand what you're modeling—not what you think you're 
          modeling, but what is actually there.
        </p>

        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>The Core Principle</strong>
          <p>
            Ontological clarity informed by epistemology is necessary for computer modeling and 
            scientific progress. This means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ontology:</strong> What exists? What are the fundamental entities and relationships?</li>
            <li><strong>Epistemology:</strong> How do we know? What are the limits and methods of our knowledge?</li>
            <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> Computational representations that respect ontological reality and epistemological constraints</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>What Is "Labyrinthine Orthogonal" Modeling?</h2>
        
        <h3>Labyrinthine: Complexity Without Confusion</h3>
        <p>
          Nature's systems are intricate, with many interconnected pathways and components. 
          A labyrinth is complex but not random—it has structure, even if that structure isn't 
          immediately apparent. Labyrinthine modeling embraces this complexity while maintaining 
          clear navigation through it.
        </p>

        <div className="card">
          <h3>Labyrinthine Characteristics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple pathways:</strong> Systems can reach similar states through different routes</li>
            <li><strong>Recursive structure:</strong> Patterns repeat at different scales</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden connections:</strong> Apparent dead ends may connect to distant parts of the system</li>
            <li><strong>Navigable complexity:</strong> Despite intricacy, there's an underlying logic</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Orthogonal: Independent Dimensions of Variation</h3>
        <p>
          In mathematics and computer science, orthogonal means "independent" or "uncorrelated." 
          Orthogonal modeling identifies truly independent dimensions of system variation, avoiding 
          the trap of treating correlated phenomena as separate causes.
        </p>

        <div className="card">
          <h3>Orthogonal Characteristics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Independent variables:</strong> Changes in one don't necessitate changes in others</li>
            <li><strong>Clean separation:</strong> Different aspects of the system operate on different axes</li>
            <li><strong>Minimal interference:</strong> Orthogonal components don't create spurious interactions</li>
            <li><strong>Composable understanding:</strong> You can understand each dimension separately, then combine them</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>Why "Labyrinthine Orthogonal"?</strong>
          <p>
            The combination acknowledges that:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Natural systems are genuinely complex (labyrinthine)</li>
            <li>But that complexity has structure based on independent principles (orthogonal)</li>
            <li>Models must capture both the complexity and the independence</li>
            <li>Navigation through the labyrinth becomes possible when you understand the orthogonal dimensions</li>

        <h2>Grounding in Philosophy of Science</h2>
        
        <p>
          Mendoza's computational modeling is rigorously grounded in classical philosophy of science. 
          This isn't ornamental—it's essential for avoiding the conceptual confusions that plague 
          mainstream approaches.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Philosophical Foundations</h3>
        
        <div className="card-grid">
          <div className="card">
            <h3>1. Ontological Realism</h3>
            <p>
              There is a real structure to natural systems, independent of our theories about them. 
              Our models should aim to capture this structure, not just predict observations.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="card">
            <h3>2. Epistemological Humility</h3>
            <p>
              Our knowledge is limited and theory-laden. Models should explicitly represent 
              uncertainty and the boundaries of what we can know from available data.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="card">
            <h3>3. Theoretical Pluralism</h3>
            <p>
              Multiple models may capture different aspects of the same system. The goal isn't 
              "the one true model" but a family of models that illuminate different facets.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="card">
            <h3>4. Computational Naturalism</h3>
            <p>
              Nature operates computationally—not metaphorically, but literally. Physical, 
              biological, and information systems are all computational substrates.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="warning-box">
          <strong>What Happens Without Philosophical Grounding</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ontological confusion:</strong> Models conflate distinct phenomena (like heat and information)</li>
            <li><strong>Epistemological overreach:</strong> Models claim more certainty than data warrant</li>
            <li><strong>Paradigm lock-in:</strong> Inability to recognize when frameworks need replacement</li>
            <li><strong>Missed connections:</strong> Failure to see patterns across disciplines</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Interdisciplinary Knowledge Integration</h2>
        
        <p>
          A key aspect of Mendoza's approach is the recognition that <strong>disciplines are simply 
          convenient category names</strong>. Scientific computation is absolutely discipline-boundless, 
          but ontology-driven.
        </p>

        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>The Discipline-Boundless Principle</strong>
          <p>
            Physics, biology, chemistry, information theory, computer science—these are human 
            organizational categories, not natural boundaries. Nature's computational substrate 
            operates according to principles that transcend disciplinary divisions.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
            This means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A principle discovered in thermodynamics may illuminate immunology</li>
            <li>Information theory may clarify quantum mechanics</li>
            <li>Computational biology may reveal universal optimization principles</li>
            <li>The same parsimony constraints operate across all domains</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Iterating Across Disciplinary Space</h3>
        <p>
          Mendoza's methodology involves iterating <strong>consciously, rationally, and aggressively</strong> 
          across both intra- and interdisciplinary space:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consciously:</strong> With explicit awareness of ontological assumptions and epistemological limits</li>
          <li><strong>Rationally:</strong> Following logical principles and computational constraints</li>
          <li><strong>Aggressively:</strong> Not hesitating to challenge established paradigms when ontological clarity demands it</li>
          <li><strong>Intra-disciplinary:</strong> Within traditional boundaries, ensuring internal consistency</li>
          <li><strong>Inter-disciplinary:</strong> Across traditional boundaries, recognizing shared computational foundations</li>
        </ul>

        <div className="interactive-demo">
          <h3>Example: Cross-Disciplinary Insight</h3>
          <p><strong>Observation in thermodynamics:</strong> Systems evolve toward maximum entropy (energy dispersal)</p>
          <p><strong>Observation in information theory:</strong> Efficient coding minimizes expected message length</p>
          <p><strong>Observation in biology:</strong> Metabolic pathways use minimal free energy</p>
          <p><strong>Observation in quantum mechanics:</strong> Systems follow paths of stationary action</p>
          
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem' }}><strong>Discipline-bounded thinking:</strong></p>
          <p style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem', borderLeft: '3px solid var(--accent-color)' }}>
            "These are separate phenomena in different domains, perhaps with some vague analogies."
          </p>
          
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem' }}><strong>Discipline-boundless thinking:</strong></p>
          <p style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem', borderLeft: '3px solid var(--primary-color)' }}>
            "These are all manifestations of computational parsimony—nature's prime directive to 
            minimize complexity in system evolution. The 'different domains' are human categories; 
            the underlying computational substrate is unified."

      </div>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Information-Theoretic Background</h2>
        
        <p>
          Mendoza's framework is deeply grounded in information theory, recognizing it as the 
          appropriate language for describing nature's computational substrate.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Information-Theoretic Concepts</h3>
        
        <div className="card-grid">
          <div className="card">
            <h3>Minimum Description Length</h3>
            <p>
              The simplest model that adequately describes data is likely closest to truth. 
              This is computational parsimony applied to model selection.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="card">
            <h3>Algorithmic Complexity</h3>
            <p>
              The shortest program that generates a pattern captures its essential structure. 
              Nature operates with minimal algorithmic complexity.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="card">
            <h3>Information Geometry</h3>
            <p>
              Probability distributions form geometric spaces. Natural processes follow geodesics 
              (shortest paths) in these information spaces.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="card">
            <h3>Channel Capacity</h3>
            <p>
              Fundamental limits on information transmission apply to physical, biological, 
              and computational systems. These limits are features, not bugs.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>Why Information Theory?</strong>
          <p>
            Information theory provides the natural language for describing computational processes 
            because it's based on fundamental principles:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Quantification of uncertainty and information</li>
            <li>Fundamental limits on processing and transmission</li>
            <li>Relationships between coding, compression, and prediction</li>
            <li>Universal measures that apply across substrates</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
            When Shannon developed information theory, he wasn't just creating a theory of 
            communication—he was discovering the mathematics of nature's computational substrate.

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Nature's DRY Principle</h2>
        
        <p>
          In software engineering, the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) states that "every piece 
          of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." 
          Mendoza's crucial insight: <strong>nature follows an even stricter DRY principle</strong>.
        </p>

        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>Nature's Code Is Incessantly Minimal</strong>
          <p>
            Nature doesn't repeat mechanisms, doesn't maintain redundant processes, doesn't use 
            more complexity than necessary. This isn't anthropomorphic projection—it's a consequence 
            of computational parsimony as a fundamental constraint.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetic code:</strong> Minimal set of codons encodes all proteins</li>
            <li><strong>Physical laws:</strong> Incredibly compact mathematical expressions govern vast domains</li>
            <li><strong>Metabolic pathways:</strong> Shared intermediates used across multiple processes</li>
            <li><strong>Neural coding:</strong> Sparse representations with minimal redundancy</li>
            <li><strong>Quantum states:</strong> Minimum information content compatible with observations</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Implications for Modeling</h3>
        <pre className="code-block">{`# Bad model: Violates DRY, multiple explanations for same phenomenon
class BadImmunityModel:
    def respond_to_bacteria(self, bacteria):
        # Special pathway for bacteria
        return self.bacterial_response(bacteria)
    
    def respond_to_virus(self, virus):
        # Different pathway for viruses
        return self.viral_response(virus)
    
    def respond_to_toxin(self, toxin):
        # Yet another pathway for toxins
        return self.toxin_response(toxin)
    # Each threat type gets its own mechanism

# Good model: Follows DRY, unified principle
class GoodImmunityModel:
    def respond_to_threat(self, threat, context):
        danger_level = self.assess_danger(context)
        if danger_level > threshold:
            return self.activate_response(threat, danger_level)
        return self.maintain_tolerance()
    # One mechanism based on actual principle: danger detection`}</pre>

        <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
          The good model is simpler, more parsimonious, and more accurate—because it reflects 
          nature's actual DRY principle rather than imposing human categorical thinking.

        <h2>In Silico Experiments: Building Blocks for Discovery</h2>
        
        <p>
          Mendoza's approach uses computational models not just to simulate known phenomena, but 
          as <strong>building blocks that eventually reveal what was hidden</strong>.
        </p>

        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>The Discovery Process</strong>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Establish ontology:</strong> Clarify what actually exists in the system</li>
            <li><strong>Identify orthogonal dimensions:</strong> Find independent axes of variation</li>
            <li><strong>Build minimal models:</strong> Implement simplest representations of core principles</li>

            <p><strong>Evolutionary biology:</strong> Organisms minimize fitness costs</p>
            <p><strong>Unified view:</strong> All are minimizing computational complexity under constraints</p>
          </div>

          <div className="card">
            <h3>Pattern: Sparse Coding</h3>
            <p><strong>Information theory:</strong> Efficient codes are sparse</p>
            <p><strong>Neural systems:</strong> Sensory coding is sparse</p>
            <p><strong>Quantum mechanics:</strong> Measurements produce sparse outcomes</p>

          These aren't coincidences or analogies—they're the same computational principle operating

          Labyrinthine orthogonal computational modeling, grounded in philosophy of science and

        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Building accurate models:</strong> Based on correct ontology, not convenient assumptions</li>

        </ul>

        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>The Ultimate Goal</strong>
          <p>
            Not just better models, but <strong>understanding nature as a computational substrate</strong> 
            operating under the prime directive of parsimony. This understanding transforms how we
