        <p>
          The term "quantum mechanics" carries deep conceptual baggage. Just as Clausius' use of 
          "heat" confused thermodynamic entropy with something it wasn't, the word "mechanics" in 
          quantum mechanics obscures what we're actually investigating.

          <strong>Quantum Parsimony</strong> is Ken Mendoza's term for what quantum mechanics was 
          supposed to be—a framework for understanding nature's computational substrate operating 
          under the prime directive of parsimony: minimal complexity, maximal efficiency.

        <h2>The Math Is a Grammar Missing Structure</h2>
        
        <p>
          Mendoza's key insight: <strong>the current corpus of quantum mechanics is a grammar missing 
          a structure</strong>. The mathematical formalism works brilliantly for predictions, but lacks 
          the conceptual framework that explains WHY it works.
        </p>

        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>Grammar vs Structure</strong>
          <p>
            <strong>Grammar:</strong> Rules for manipulating symbols (quantum operators, wave functions, 
            measurement postulates)
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The underlying principles that explain why those rules work 
            (computational parsimony, information-theoretic constraints, optimization principles)
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>What the Missing Structure Provides</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Why superposition?</strong> Because it's computationally optimal to maintain multiple possibilities until forced to choose</li>
          <li><strong>Why entanglement?</strong> Because it's the most parsimonious way to represent correlated systems</li>
          <li><strong>Why measurement "collapses"?</strong> Because extracting classical information requires computational commitment to specific outcomes</li>
          <li><strong>Why uncertainty principle?</strong> Because perfect information about conjugate variables would require infinite computational resources</li>
          <li><strong>Why path integral?</strong> Because summing over all paths is nature's way of computing the most parsimonious evolution</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Example: Double-Slit Experiment</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Mechanical interpretation:</strong></p>
          <p style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem', borderLeft: '3px solid var(--accent-color)' }}>
            "The particle somehow goes through both slits, interferes with itself, but when we 
            measure which slit it went through, the interference pattern disappears. This is 
            mysterious and counterintuitive."

          <p style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem', borderLeft: '3px solid var(--primary-color)' }}>
            "Nature computes the outcome using the minimal information available. Without measuring 
            which slit, the minimal computation considers both paths—this is parsimonious because 
            committing to one path without information would be arbitrary (non-parsimonious). When 
            we measure which slit, we add information that changes the computational constraint—now 
            the parsimonious solution is path-specific because we have path information. The 'collapse' 
            is updating the computation given new information, not a physical mechanism."

        <h2>The Structure of Computation</h2>
        
        <p>
          The missing structure is <strong>the structure of computation</strong> itself, governed 
          by nature's prime directive: parsimony.

        <div className="card-grid">
          <div className="card">
            <h3>Minimum Description Length</h3>
            <p>
              Quantum states represent the minimal information needed to describe a system. 
              Any "hidden variables" would violate parsimony by adding unnecessary information.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="card">
            <h3>Channel Capacity Limits</h3>
            <p>
              Quantum limitations (uncertainty, no-cloning theorem) arise from fundamental limits 
              on information processing and transmission—you can't get more information out than 
              the system actually contains.

          <div className="card">
            <h3>Algorithmic Efficiency</h3>
            <p>
              Quantum algorithms (like Shor's factoring algorithm) are efficient not because of 
              mysterious quantum "parallelism," but because they exploit computational parsimony 
              in nature's information processing.

              Quantum superposition and entanglement are optimal coding strategies for representing

        <h3>1. Superposition</h3>
        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>Mechanical view:</strong> "The particle is in multiple states simultaneously."
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>Quantum Parsimony view:</strong> "Nature maintains all possibilities compatible 
          with available information because committing to one possibility without information would 
          be computationally wasteful. Superposition is the most parsimonious representation given 
          incomplete information."
        </div>

        <h3>2. Entanglement</h3>
        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>Mechanical view:</strong> "Particles are mysteriously connected; measuring one 
          instantly affects the other."
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>Quantum Parsimony view:</strong> "Correlated systems share computational structure. 
          Representing each system independently would duplicate information. Entanglement is the 
          parsimonious way to represent correlations—one shared computation instead of two separate 
          ones. 'Measurement' extracts information from this shared structure."
        </div>

        <h3>3. Uncertainty Principle</h3>
        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>Mechanical view:</strong> "You can't simultaneously know position and momentum 
          because measurement disturbs the system."
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>Quantum Parsimony view:</strong> "Perfect information about conjugate variables 
          would require infinite computational resources. The uncertainty principle is a fundamental 
          computational constraint—nature doesn't maintain information that would violate parsimony. 
          The trade-off between conjugate variables reflects minimal information representation."
        </div>

        <h3>4. Measurement "Problem"</h3>
        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>Mechanical view:</strong> "Measurement causes wave function collapse—but what counts 
          as a measurement? This is a deep problem."
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>Quantum Parsimony view:</strong> "There's no measurement 'problem.' Extracting 
          classical information from a quantum system requires computational commitment to specific 
          outcomes. This commitment updates the system's information state—not because of physical 
          'collapse,' but because new information changes the computational constraints. The apparent 
          'problem' disappears when you stop thinking mechanically and start thinking computationally."
        </div>

        <h3>5. Wave-Particle Duality</h3>
        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>Mechanical view:</strong> "Quantum objects are sometimes waves, sometimes particles—a 
          mysterious duality."
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>Quantum Parsimony view:</strong> "There's no duality. 'Wave' and 'particle' are 
          classical mechanical categories that don't apply to quantum systems. What we call wave-like 
          or particle-like behavior depends on the information extraction method (measurement context). 
          The system itself is just executing parsimonious computations—we see 'waves' or 'particles' 
          based on what classical information we extract."

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand quantum phenomena as manifestations of computational efficiency</li>
            <li>Connect quantum theory to information theory and other domains</li>
            <li>Build computational models grounded in actual principles</li>
            <li>See through the fog of mechanical metaphors</li>
            <li>Recognize nature's unified computational substrate</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
            This is what quantum mechanics was supposed to be—a framework for understanding nature's 
            computation. Now, through ontological clarity, it can finally become that.
